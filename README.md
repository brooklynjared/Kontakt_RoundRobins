# Kontakt Round Robin Library

Round robin library for Kontakt percussion instruments. Assumes that sample content is unpitched and that all RR samples are mapped in one group, starting from note zero.

Requires Sublime KSP for use of macros from library within the main script.

Contains numerous macros for creating RR sets with varying numbers of RR positions, and macros for playback handling within the `on note` callback.
